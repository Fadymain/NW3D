# WEB3 NETFLIX 

A netflix clone which a user can play movies, or add to their Mylist to play at another time. Authentication to the dApp is handled through the users crypto wallet address, facilitated by Moralis Web3 Development Platform. Building this was a fun challenge due to exposure and usage of the Web3 development platform, overall it was a great learning experience.
